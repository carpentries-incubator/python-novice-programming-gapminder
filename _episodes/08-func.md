<!-- FIXME

At this point,
we've written code to draw some interesting features in our inflammation data,
loop over all our data files to quickly draw these plots for each of them,
and have Python make decisions based on what it sees in our data.
-->

Our code is getting pretty long and complicated;
what if we had thousands of datasets,
and didn't want to generate a figure for every single one?
Commenting out the figure-drawing code is a nuisance.
Also, what if we want to use that code again,
on a different dataset or at a different point in our program?
Cutting and pasting it is going to make our code get very long and very repetitive,
very quickly.
We'd like a way to package our code so that it is easier to reuse,
and Python provides for this by letting us define things called 'functions' ---
a shorthand way of re-executing longer pieces of code.
Let's start by defining a function `fahr_to_celsius` that converts temperatures
from Fahrenheit to Celsius:

~~~
def fahr_to_celsius(temp):
    return ((temp - 32) * (5/9))
~~~
{: .language-python}

![Labeled parts of a Python function definition](../fig/python-function.svg)


The function definition opens with the keyword `def` followed by the
name of the function (`fahr_to_celsius`) and a parenthesized list of parameter names (`temp`). The
[body]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#body) of the function --- the
statements that are executed when it runs --- is indented below the
definition line.  The body concludes with a `return` keyword followed by the return value.

When we call the function,
the values we pass to it are assigned to those variables
so that we can use them inside the function.
Inside the function,
we use a [return statement]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#return-statement) to send a result
back to whoever asked for it.

Let's try running our function.

~~~
fahr_to_celsius(32)
~~~
{: .language-python}

This command should call our function, using "32" as the input and return the function value.

In fact, calling our own function is no different from calling any other function:
~~~
print('freezing point of water:', fahr_to_celsius(32), 'C')
print('boiling point of water:', fahr_to_celsius(212), 'C')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
freezing point of water: 0.0 C
boiling point of water: 100.0 C
~~~
{: .output}

We've successfully called the function that we defined,
and we have access to the value that we returned.


## Composing Functions

Now that we've seen how to turn Fahrenheit into Celsius,
we can also write the function to turn Celsius into Kelvin:

~~~
def celsius_to_kelvin(temp_c):
    return temp_c + 273.15

print('freezing point of water in Kelvin:', celsius_to_kelvin(0.))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
freezing point of water in Kelvin: 273.15
~~~
{: .output}

What about converting Fahrenheit to Kelvin?
We could write out the formula,
but we don't need to.
Instead,
we can [compose]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#compose) the two functions we have already created:

~~~
def fahr_to_kelvin(temp_f):
    temp_c = fahr_to_celsius(temp_f)
    temp_k = celsius_to_kelvin(temp_c)
    return temp_k

print('boiling point of water in Kelvin:', fahr_to_kelvin(212.0))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
boiling point of water in Kelvin: 373.15
~~~
{: .output}

This is our first taste of how larger programs are built:
we define basic operations,
then combine them in ever-larger chunks to get the effect we want.
Real-life functions will usually be larger than the ones shown here --- typically half a dozen
to a few dozen lines --- but they shouldn't ever be much longer than that,
or the next person who reads it won't be able to understand what's going on.

## Variable Scope

In composing our temperature conversion functions, we created variables inside of those functions,
`temp`, `temp_c`, `temp_f`, and `temp_k`.
We refer to these variables as [local variables]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#local-variable)
because they no longer exist once the function is done executing.
If we try to access their values outside of the function, we will encounter an error:
~~~
print('Again, temperature in Kelvin was:', temp_k)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-eed2471d229b> in <module>
----> 1 print('Again, temperature in Kelvin was:', temp_k)

NameError: name 'temp_k' is not defined
~~~
{: .error}

If you want to reuse the temperature in Kelvin after you have calculated it with `fahr_to_kelvin`,
you can store the result of the function call in a variable:
~~~
temp_kelvin = fahr_to_kelvin(212.0)
print('temperature in Kelvin was:', temp_kelvin)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
temperature in Kelvin was: 373.15
~~~
{: .output}

The variable `temp_kelvin`, being defined outside any function,
is said to be [global]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#global-variable).

Inside a function, one can read the value of such global variables:
~~~
def print_temperatures():
  print('temperature in Fahrenheit was:', temp_fahr)
  print('temperature in Kelvin was:', temp_kelvin)

temp_fahr = 212.0
temp_kelvin = fahr_to_kelvin(temp_fahr)

print_temperatures()
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
temperature in Fahrenheit was: 212.0
temperature in Kelvin was: 373.15
~~~
{: .output}



Now that we know how to wrap bits of code up in functions,
we can make our inflammation analysis easier to read and easier to reuse.
First, let's make a `visualize` function that generates our plots:

~~~
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
def visualize(filename):
    data = pd.read_csv(filename, index_col='country')
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12.0, 5.0))
    
    data.columns = data.columns.str.strip('gdpPercap_')

    ax[0].set_ylabel(data.index[0])
    ax[0].plot(data.loc[data.index[0]])
    ax[1].set_ylabel(data.index[1])
    ax[1].plot(data.loc[data.index[1]])
    
    fig.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
~~~
{: .language-python}


Wait! Didn't we forget to specify what both of these functions should return? Well, we didn't.
In Python, functions are not required to include a `return` statement and can be used for
the sole purpose of grouping together pieces of code that conceptually do one thing. In such cases,
function names usually describe what they do, _e.g._ `visualize`. 

Notice that rather than jumbling this code together in one giant `for` loop,
we can now read and reuse both ideas separately.
We can reproduce the previous analysis with a much simpler `for` loop:

~~~
filenames = sorted(glob.glob('data/gapminder_gdp_a[fs]*.csv'))

for filename in filenames:
    print(filename)
    visualize(filename)
~~~
{: .language-python}

By giving our functions human-readable names,
we can more easily read and understand what is happening in the `for` loop.
Even better, if at some later date we want to use either of those pieces of code again,
we can do so in a single line.

## Readable functions

Consider these two functions:

~~~
def s(p):
    a = 0
    for v in p:
        a += v
    m = a / len(p)
    d = 0
    for v in p:
        d += (v - m) * (v - m)
    return numpy.sqrt(d / (len(p) - 1))

def std_dev(sample):
    sample_sum = 0
    for value in sample:
        sample_sum += value

    sample_mean = sample_sum / len(sample)

    sum_squared_devs = 0
    for value in sample:
        sum_squared_devs += (value - sample_mean) * (value - sample_mean)

    return numpy.sqrt(sum_squared_devs / (len(sample) - 1))
~~~
{: .language-python}

The functions `s` and `std_dev` are computationally equivalent (they
both calculate the sample standard deviation), but to a human reader,
they look very different. You probably found `std_dev` much easier to
read and understand than `s`.

As this example illustrates, both documentation and a programmer's
_coding style_ combine to determine how easy it is for others to read
and understand the programmer's code. Choosing meaningful variable
names and using blank spaces to break the code into logical "chunks"
are helpful techniques for producing _readable code_. This is useful
not only for sharing code with others, but also for the original
programmer. If you need to revisit code that you wrote months ago and
haven't thought about since then, you will appreciate the value of
readable code!
