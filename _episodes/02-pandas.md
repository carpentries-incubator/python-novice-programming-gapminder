## Our dataset
We are using a dataset generated by [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/tag/gdp-per-capita/) which describes income per person (GDP per capita) and life expectancy over a series of years between 1952 and 2007. We have a csv file for each continent and another
that combines all data. 

The data sets are stored in [comma-separated values]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#comma-separated-values) (CSV) format with each row holding information on a single country.

The first three rows of the first file look like this:

~~~
"continent","country","gdpPercap_1952","gdpPercap_1957","gdpPercap_1962","gdpPercap_1967","gdpPercap_1972","gdpPercap_1977","gdpPercap_1982","gdpPercap_1987","gdpPercap_1992","gdpPercap_1997","gdpPercap_2002","gdpPercap_2007","lifeExp_1952","lifeExp_1957","lifeExp_1962","lifeExp_1967","lifeExp_1972","lifeExp_1977","lifeExp_1982","lifeExp_1987","lifeExp_1992","lifeExp_1997","lifeExp_2002","lifeExp_2007","pop_1952","pop_1957","pop_1962","pop_1967","pop_1972","pop_1977","pop_1982","pop_1987","pop_1992","pop_1997","pop_2002","pop_2007"

We'll learn more about how programming can help us explore this data.

## Libraries

Words are useful, but what's more useful are the sentences and stories we build with them.
Similarly, while a lot of powerful, general tools are built into Python,
specialized tools built up from these basic units live in
[libraries]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#library)
that can be called upon when needed.

## Use the Pandas library to do explore tabular data.

Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment out of a storage locker and setting it
up on the bench. Libraries provide additional functionality to the basic Python package, much like
a new piece of equipment adds functionality to a lab space. Just like in the lab, importing too
many libraries can sometimes complicate and slow down your programs - so we only import what we
need for each program.

*   Pandas is a widely-used Python library for statistics, particularly on tabular data.
*   Borrows many features from R's dataframes.
    *   A 2-dimensional table whose columns have names
        and potentially have different data types.
*   Load it with `import pandas as pd`. The alias pd is commonly used for Pandas.
*   Read a Comma Separated Values (CSV) data file with `pd.read_csv`.
    *   Argument is the name of the file to be read.
    *   Assign result to a variable to store the data that was read.

Once we've imported the library, we can ask the library to read our data file for us:
~~~
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('data/gapminder_gdp_oceania.csv')
print(data)

The expression `pd.read_csv` is a
[function call]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#function-call)
that asks Python to run the [function]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#function) `read_csv` which
belongs to the `pandas` library.
This [dotted notation]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#dotted-notation)
is used everywhere in Python: the thing that appears before the dot contains the thing that
appears after.

As an example, John Smith is the John that belongs to the Smith family.
We could use the dot notation to write his name `smith.john`,
just as `read_csv` is a function that belongs to the `pandas` library.

`pandas.read_csv` has one [parameter]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#parameter): the name of the file
we want to read. This needs to be character string
(or [string]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#string) for short), so we put it in quotes.

Our call read our file and saved the data in memory to a variable called `data`. We then checked our data had been loaded successfully by printing the variable's value to the screen.

Pandas uses backslash `\` to show wrapped lines when output is too wide to fit the screen.

> ## File Not Found
>
> Our lessons store their data files in a `data` sub-directory,
> which is why the path to the file is `data/gapminder_gdp_oceania.csv`.
> If you forget to include `data/`,
> or if you include it but your copy of the file is somewhere else,
> you will get a [runtime error]({{ page.root }}/04-built-in/#runtime-error)
> that ends with a line like this:
>
> ~~~
> FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'data/gapminder_gdp_oceania.csv'
> ~~~
> {: .error}
{: .callout}

Now that the data are in memory,
we can manipulate them.

## Use `index_col` to specify that a column's values should be used as row headings.

*   Row headings are numbers (0 and 1 in this case).
*   Really want to index by country.
*   Pass the name of the column to `read_csv` as its `index_col` parameter to do this.

data = pd.read_csv('data/gapminder_gdp_oceania.csv', index_col='country')

*   This is a `DataFrame`
*   Two rows named `'Australia'` and `'New Zealand'`
*   Twelve columns, each of which has two actual 64-bit floating point values.
    *   We will talk later about null values, which are used to represent missing observations.
*   Uses 208 bytes of memory.

## The `DataFrame.columns` variable stores information about the dataframe's columns.

*   Note that this is data, *not* a method.  (It doesn't have parentheses.)
    *   Like `math.pi`.
    *   So do not use `()` to try to call it.

## Note about Pandas DataFrames/Series

A DataFrame is a collection of Series;
The DataFrame is the way Pandas represents a table, and Series is the data-structure
Pandas use to represent a column.

Pandas is built on top of the Numpy library, which in practice means that
most of the methods defined for Numpy Arrays apply to Pandas Series/DataFrames.

What makes Pandas so attractive is the powerful interface to access individual records
of the table, proper handling of missing values, and relational-databases operations
between DataFrames.

## Selecting values

To access a value at the position `[i,j]` of a DataFrame, we have two options, depending on
what is the meaning of `i` in use.
Remember that a DataFrame provides an *index* as a way to identify the rows of the table;
a row, then, has a *position* inside the table as well as a *label*, which
uniquely identifies its *entry* in the DataFrame.

## Use `DataFrame.iloc[..., ...]` to select values by their (entry) position

*   Can specify location by numerical index analogously to 2D version of character selection in strings.

import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('data/gapminder_gdp_europe.csv', index_col='country')
print(data.iloc[0, 0])

The expression `data[30, 20]` accesses the element at row 30, column 20. While this expression may
not surprise you,
 `data[0, 0]` might.
Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB and R start counting at 1
because that's what human beings have done for thousands of years.
Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0
because it represents an offset from the first value in the array (the second
value is offset by one index from the first value). This is closer to the way
that computers represent arrays (if you are interested in the historical
reasons behind counting indices from zero, you can read
[Mike Hoye's blog post](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2013/10/22/citation-needed/)).
As a result,
if we have an M×N array in Python,
its indices go from 0 to M-1 on the first axis
and 0 to N-1 on the second.
It takes a bit of getting used to,
but one way to remember the rule is that
the index is how many steps we have to take from the start to get the item we want.

!["data" is a 3 by 3 numpy array containing row 0: ['A', 'B', 'C'], row 1: ['D', 'E', 'F'], and
row 2: ['G', 'H', 'I']. Starting in the upper left hand corner, data[0, 0] = 'A', data[0, 1] = 'B',
data[0, 2] = 'C', data[1, 0] = 'D', data[1, 1] = 'E', data[1, 2] = 'F', data[2, 0] = 'G',
data[2, 1] = 'H', and data[2, 2] = 'I',
in the bottom right hand corner.](../fig/python-zero-index.svg)

In the above code, we discover that **slicing using `loc` is inclusive at both
ends**, which differs from **slicing using `iloc`**, where slicing indicates
everything up to but not including the final index. 


## Result of slicing can be used in further operations.

*   Usually don't just print a slice.
*   All the statistical operators that work on entire dataframes
    work the same way on slices.
*   E.g., calculate max of a slice.
